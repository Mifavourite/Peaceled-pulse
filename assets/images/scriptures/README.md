- **Size**: Recommended minimum 800x600px for good quality display
- **Content**: Each image should display the scripture reference and text in a visually appealing way

## Instructions

1. Create or obtain 15 scripture images
2. Name them exactly as listed above (scripture_1.png through scripture_15.png)
3. Place all files in this directory: `assets/images/scriptures/`
4. The app will automatically rotate through these images during the lock period

## Fallback Behavior

If images are not found, the app will display a placeholder with the scripture reference text. This ensures the app functions even without all assets present.
